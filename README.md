# rustfuzz

**rustfuzz** is a high-performance, advanced web fuzzer written in Rust. It‚Äôs designed for security professionals and developers to discover hidden files, directories, and vulnerabilities on web servers. Inspired by tools like `ffuf`, rustfuzz emphasizes speed, flexibility, and modern security research workflows.

## üöÄ Features

- üåê **URL and Directory Fuzzing**: Quickly identify hidden endpoints, files, and directories.
- ‚ö° **High Performance**: Async/multithreaded engine for maximum speed.
- üß∞ **Flexible & Customizable**:
  - Specify target URLs (`-u`, `--url`)
  - Custom wordlists (`-w`, `--wordlist`)
  - Status code matching (`-m`, `--matcher`)
  - Custom headers, cookies, and authentication tokens
  - Timeout and rate limiting
  - **Config file support** (`--config`) for reusable setups
  - Proxy support (HTTP/SOCKS5/Burp Suite)
  - Export results (`--export`) in JSON or CSV
  - Payload injection (`--payloads`)
  - Mutation-based fuzzing (`--mutate`)
  - Smart crawling (`--crawl`) to discover more endpoints
  - OpenAPI/Swagger parsing (`--openapi`)
  - Results analysis (`--analyze`)
- üîí **Modern Security Workflows**:
  - Designed for both bug bounty hunters and blue teams
  - Diagnostic output and robust error handling

## üì¶ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/martian58/rustfuzz.git
   cd rustfuzz
   ```

2. Build the project using Cargo:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. The binary will be available at:
   ```bash
   ./target/release/rustfuzz
   ```

## üìñ Usage

Run `rustfuzz` with your desired options:

```bash
./rustfuzz -u <URL> -w <wordlist> -t <threads>
```

### Example (CLI only):

```bash
./rustfuzz -u https://example.com/FUZZ -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -t 20
```

### Using a Configuration File

You can store your options in a TOML config file and load them with the `--config` flag:

```bash
./rustfuzz --config rustfuzz.toml
```

**Example `rustfuzz.toml`:**
```toml
url = "https://example.com"
wordlist = "wordlists/common.txt"
threads = 20
timeout = 10
matcher = "200,301,302"
proxy = "http://127.0.0.1:8080"
export = "results/output.json"
# Add other options as needed
```

- Any command-line argument will override the value in the config file.
- The config file supports all options available via CLI.

### More Examples

With a proxy (e.g., Burp Suite):
```bash
./rustfuzz --config config.toml --proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

Exporting results:
```bash
./rustfuzz -u https://example.com -w words.txt --export results.json
```

Advanced fuzzing with payloads:
```bash
./rustfuzz -u https://example.com --payloads payloads/xss.txt
```

Smart crawling:
```bash
./rustfuzz -u https://example.com --crawl
```

Analyze exported results:
```bash
./rustfuzz --analyze results.json
```

For the full list of options and help:
```bash
./rustfuzz --help
```
